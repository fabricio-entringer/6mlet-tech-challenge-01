   make venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   make install
   ```

Alternatively, you can do it manually:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Application

1. Start the FastAPI server:

   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```

   Or using make:

   ```bash
   make run
   ```

2. The API will be available at: `http://localhost:8000`
3. Interactive API documentation: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
4. Alternative API documentation: `http://localhost:8000/redoc`

  - Schema definitions and models
  - **Production**: <https://6mlet-tech-challenge-01.up.railway.app/redoc>

- **OpenAPI JSON Schema**: `http://localhost:8000/openapi.json`
  - Raw OpenAPI specification in JSON format
  - Can be imported into other API tools (Postman, Insomnia, etc.)
  - **Production**: <https://6mlet-tech-challenge-01.up.railway.app/openapi.json>

## Testing

Run tests using pytest:

```bash
pytest
```

Or using make:

```bash
make test
```

## CI/CD Workflows

This project includes comprehensive GitHub Actions workflows for continuous integration and deployment:

### Available Workflows

1. **CI Workflow** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
   - Runs on every push and pull request to `main` and `develop` branches
   - Tests with Python 3.12
   - Runs the full test suite
   - Validates app import functionality

2. **Build and Test PR Workflow** (`.github/workflows/pr-build-test.yml`)
   - Comprehensive PR validation workflow
   - **Multi-version testing**: Tests with Python 3.11 and 3.12
   - **Build validation**: Creates and validates package builds
   - **Security scanning**: Runs `safety` and `bandit` security checks
   - **Code quality**: Validates formatting with `black`, import sorting with `isort`, and type checking with `mypy`
   - **Application testing**: Validates the application starts correctly and endpoints respond
   - **Summary report**: Provides a comprehensive summary of all checks

```

## Version Control with Commitizen

This project uses commitizen for conventional commits:

1. Make your changes
2. Stage your files: `git add .`
3. Create a conventional commit: `make commit` or `cz commit`
4. Bump version: `make bump` or `cz bump`

## Development Commands

This project includes a Makefile that provides convenient shortcuts for common development tasks. The Makefile automates environment setup, testing, running, and maintenance operations.

### Available Make Commands

#### Environment Setup

- **`make help`** - Display all available commands with descriptions
  ```bash
  make help
  ```

- **`make venv`** - Create a Python virtual environment
  ```bash
  make venv
  ```
  Creates a new virtual environment in the `venv/` directory using Python 3. After running this command, activate the environment with `source venv/bin/activate`.

- **`make install`** - Install project dependencies
  ```bash
  make install
  ```
  Automatically creates a virtual environment (if it doesn't exist), upgrades pip to the latest version, and installs all dependencies from `requirements.txt`. This is equivalent to running the installation steps manually but in one command.

#### Development Operations

- **`make test`** - Run the test suite
  ```bash
  make test
  ```
  Executes all tests using pytest within the virtual environment. Tests are located in the `tests/` directory and include unit tests for the FastAPI application.

- **`make run`** - Start the FastAPI development server
  ```bash
  make run
  ```
  Launches the FastAPI application using the `run.py` script. The server will be available at `http://localhost:8000` with automatic API documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

#### Maintenance

- **`make clean`** - Clean up generated files and cache
  ```bash
  make clean
  ```
  Removes Python cache files, bytecode files (`.pyc`), `__pycache__` directories, `.egg-info` directories, and pytest cache. Use this to clean up your workspace and resolve potential caching issues.

#### Version Control

- **`make commit`** - Create a conventional commit
  ```bash
  make commit
  ```
  Opens the commitizen interactive prompt to create a conventional commit. This ensures your commit messages follow the conventional commit format (feat, fix, docs, etc.).

- **`make bump`** - Bump project version
  ```bash
  make bump
  ```
  Automatically increments the project version based on conventional commits, updates version files, and creates a git tag.

### How the Makefile Works

The Makefile uses the `.PHONY` directive to declare targets that don't create files with the same name. Each command uses the virtual environment's Python interpreter (`venv/bin/python`) and pip (`venv/bin/pip`) to ensure commands run in the isolated environment.

Key features:
- **Dependency Management**: Commands like `install` depend on `venv`, ensuring the virtual environment exists before installing packages
- **Virtual Environment Isolation**: All Python commands use `venv/bin/` executables
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Commands work on Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS)

### Usage Examples

1. **First-time setup**:
   ```bash
   make install  # Creates venv and installs dependencies
   source venv/bin/activate  # Activate the environment
   ```

2. **Daily development workflow**:
   ```bash
   make test     # Run tests before making changes
   make run      # Start the development server
   make clean    # Clean up when needed
   ```

3. **Version control workflow**:

   ```bash
   git add .
   make commit   # Create conventional commit
   make bump     # Bump version when ready for release
   ```
