## 🏗️ Architecture Features

### Multi-Stage Build
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.12-slim as base        # Common base layer
FROM base as development             # Dev stage with hot reload
FROM base as production              # Optimized prod stage
```

### Development Environment
- 🔄 **Hot reloading** - Source code mounted as volumes
- 🧪 **Test integration** - Development dependencies included
- 📝 **Debug logging** - Detailed logging for development
- 🔧 **Easy debugging** - Shell access and development tools

### Production Environment
- 🔒 **Security hardened** - Non-root user, read-only mounts
- ⚡ **Performance optimized** - Multi-worker deployment
- 📊 **Resource limits** - Memory and CPU constraints
- 🏥 **Health monitoring** - Built-in health checks

### Data Management
- 💾 **Persistent volumes** - Data and logs survive container restarts
- 📂 **Volume initialization** - Automatic data setup from source files
- 🔄 **Backup/restore** - Scripts for data management

## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

### Development
```bash
# Setup development environment
make docker-setup-dev
# or
cd infra && ./docker-manage.sh setup-dev

# Access application
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

### Production
```bash
# Setup production environment
make docker-setup-prod
# or  
cd infra && ./docker-manage.sh setup-prod

# Access application
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

### Management
```bash
# View logs
make docker-logs

# Stop containers
make docker-stop

# Clean up resources
make docker-cleanup

# Validate setup
make docker-validate
```

## 🔧 Configuration Highlights

### Environment Variables
- `ENVIRONMENT`: development/production
- `LOG_LEVEL`: debug/info/warning/error
- `DATA_PATH`: CSV data files location
- `API_HOST`, `API_PORT`: Server binding configuration

### Port Mapping
- **Development**: `8000:8000` (matches existing setup)
- **Production**: `8080:8000` (avoids port conflicts)

### Volume Mounts
- **Development**: Source code, data, logs
- **Production**: Data (read-only), logs

### Health Checks
- **Interval**: 30 seconds
- **Endpoint**: `/health`
- **Retries**: 3 attempts

## 🛡️ Security Features

### Production Security
- Non-root user execution (`appuser`)
- Read-only data volumes
- Resource constraints
- Minimal base image (Python 3.12 slim)
- Security-focused build practices

### Development Security  
- Isolated Docker networks
- Environment variable management
- No sensitive data in images

## 🧪 Testing and Validation

The implementation includes comprehensive testing:

- **Syntax validation** - Docker and compose file validation
- **Build testing** - Both development and production stages
- **Configuration testing** - Environment and security settings
- **Integration testing** - End-to-end container functionality

## 📈 Benefits Achieved

1. **Consistent Environment** - Same runtime across all stages
2. **Easy Deployment** - One-command setup for any environment
3. **Development Efficiency** - Hot reloading and debugging support
4. **Production Ready** - Security and performance optimized
5. **Maintainable** - Well-documented and scripted management
6. **Scalable** - Multi-worker support and resource management

## 🔄 Integration with Existing Project

The Docker implementation seamlessly integrates with the existing project:

- ✅ **No code changes** - Application code remains untouched
- ✅ **Makefile integration** - Added Docker commands to existing workflow
- ✅ **Data compatibility** - Uses existing CSV data structure
- ✅ **Port consistency** - Development uses same port (8000)
- ✅ **Directory structure** - Docker files organized in `/infra`

## 🎉 Conclusion

Issue #24 has been fully implemented with a robust, production-ready Docker containerization solution that exceeds the original requirements. The implementation provides both development and production environments with comprehensive management tools, security features, and documentation.

The solution is ready for immediate use and testing.
